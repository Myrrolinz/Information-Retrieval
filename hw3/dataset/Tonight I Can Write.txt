Author: Pablo Neruda
Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
Write, for example, 'the night is starry and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance'.
The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.
Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.
Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.
She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.
